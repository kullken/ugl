# UGL
A package where I plan to gather various base geometry implementations and wrappers written in C++. At the moment supporting linear algebra, 3D trajectories and matrix Lie groups. Currently the linear algebra is a wrapper around the C++ library Eigen, however this might change in the future in order to remove third-party dependencies.

## Naming
The letters GL stands for Geometry Library, however the meaning of the U is definied by each user. For example the U might mean "Ugly" or "Unified" depending on the user's current mood or frustration level.
